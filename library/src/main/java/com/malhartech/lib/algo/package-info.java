 * <b>com.malhartech.lib.algo</b> is a library of algorithmic modules for reuse<br>
 * <br>
 * <br>The modules are<br>
 * <b>{@link com.malhartech.lib.algo.AllAfterMatch}</b>:  * Takes in one stream via input port "data". A compare function is imposed based on the property "key", "value", and "compare". All tuples
 * are emitted (inclusive) once a match is made. The comparison is done by getting double value from the Number.<br>
 * <b>{@link com.malhartech.lib.algo.AllAfterMatchStringValue}</b>: Takes in one stream via input port "data". A compare function is imposed based on the property "key", "value", and "compare". All tuples
 * are emitted (inclusive) once a match is made. The comparison is done by getting double value from the Number.<br>
 * <b>{@link com.malhartech.lib.algo.BottomN}</b>: Takes a stream of key value pairs via input port "data", and they are ordered by key. Bottom N of the ordered tuples per key are emitted on port "bottom" at the end of window<br>

 * <b>{@link com.malhartech.lib.algo.CompareCount}</b>: Takes in one stream via input port "data". A count is done on how many tuples satisfy the compare function. The function is given by
 * "key", "value", and "compare". If a tuple passed the test count is incremented. On end of window count is emitted on the output port "count". The comparison is done by getting double value from the Number.<br>
